# MagicDuelsDeckCheck
Utility to determine what cards you are missing from decks posted on www.magicduelshelper.com

## Installation

Download the zip file from [here](https://github.com/Aspallar/MagicDuelsDeckCheck/releases/download/v1.1.0/MagicDuelsDeckCheck.zip) unblock the zip (see below) and extract its contents to the folder where you want the application installed.

Run MagicDuelsDeckCheck.exe

The first time you run it you will receive an error message saying that the Magic Duels steam profile couldn't be loaded. Go to File->Options in the menu and specify the path
to your Magic Duels steam profile (there is some help text in the options dialog to help you locate this).

## Use

To use MagicDuelsDeckHelper just drag a deck link from the [Magic Duels Helper ](https://www.magicduelshelper.com) web site and drop it in the applications window. A page will be displayed in your browser listing the cards that you are missing, if any, and what set they can be found in.

### Deck links

If you are on a page that lists decks, just drag the link for the deck you are interested in.

## Browsers

This initial release has only been tested in Chrome, it should work in other browsers though.

If you are using Internet Explorer you will probably get a "blocked content" warning when the results page is displayed, you should allow blocked content for the page.

## Unblocking downloaded zip

Before extracting the contents of the installation zip file you should unblock the zip file, otherwise the extracted files will be marked as blocked and you will get a warning message every time you run it.

To unblock the zip right click on it and choose properties, check the 'Unblock' check box and click on ok.
